# Sign Language Recognition System

This project implements a real-time Sign Language Recognition system using:
- MediaPipe for hand landmark detection  
- ML model for gesture prediction with algorithm RFC
- Gradio for interactive web interface  

The system captures live webcam input, extracts hand landmarks, predicts characters, and builds words in real-time.
